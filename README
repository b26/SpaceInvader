#### Description of Program ####

Lunar Lander Game built in C and Sketchpad. Uses a text-based user interface built using
ncurses and signals to animate the game.

The objective of the game is to properly land the lander on the surface of the moon.
You also need to take into account how fast you are going. If your velocity is too high
you will crash, even if you've landed upright!

Game ends when you have 'Landed', 'Crashed' or by pressing 'q'. Instructions are provided
when the game starts.

#### Improvements ####

- Added color
	- Lander -> Blue
	- Land -> Black
	- Fuel Gauge -> Red

- Added Fuel Gauge
	- Fuel gauge is visual and provides no text warnings!
	- Fuel decreases everytime you hit the thrusters.
	- Unable to use thrusters once Fuel has ran out.
	- Hopefully, you can still land without thrusters :). 

- Arguments
	- Arguments are handled in any order!
	- If you enter in the wrong data for arguments, the game still runs without any issues!
	- If you forget arguments, the game tells you which argument you forgot!

#### How To Run ####
